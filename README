NonBlockingENGine by <dsp@2f30.org>,<lostd@2f30.org>

A nonblocking client/server engine for future use on sscall.
(https://github.com/quantumdream/sscall.git)
Will support SSL connections via a custom SSL wrapper.
For SSL you have to create and sign certificates and keys
by running the scripts in the ssl/ directory.

cd ssl/; sh create_ca; sh create_client; sh create_server;
sh sign_client; sh sign_server;

to test get a netcat proccess listening for udp on a port:
(BOX1) nc -ul 8888 (see the data that BOX2 sends)
(BOX2) ./nbeng BOX1 8888 (send data to BOX1 and recv from it)
(BOX1) nc -u BOX2 (send data to BOX2)
